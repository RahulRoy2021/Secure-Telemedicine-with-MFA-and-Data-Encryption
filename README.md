# Secure-Telemedicine-with-MFA-and-Data-Encryption

Overview

This project focuses on developing a secure telemedicine platform that ensures confidential communication between patients and healthcare providers. It integrates Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Advanced Encryption Techniques to safeguard sensitive medical data.

Features Implemented So Far
Data Security with AES Encryption:

Encrypts and decrypts medical images using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
Cryptographic Key Generation using GANs:

Utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks to create high-entropy, unpredictable cryptographic keys.
Image Handling with OpenCV:

Processes and encrypts medical images for secure transmission.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):

Implements Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) and email-based OTPs for secure access control.
Python-Based Implementation:

Built using TensorFlow, NumPy, PyCryptodome, and OpenCV.

Project Objectives
Secure transmission and storage of sensitive medical data.
Implement robust access control through MFA.
Provide a scalable encryption system suitable for real-time applications.
